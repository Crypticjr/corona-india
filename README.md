# Covid-19 Tracker
Live tracker for corona virus, simple and clean looking.
Data is copied from World Health Organisation in real time.
Bootstrap is used mainly for grid, and ChartsJS for charts, everything else is created from scratch by me. 
Site is responsive (mobile-friendly), it doesn't works best only on tablet pc's.
Chart with data about genders does not fetch data from api, it has to be manually updated (Until they add gender data to API)
